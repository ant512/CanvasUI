CanvasUI
-----------------

  CanvasUI is a small javascript library for creating simple user interfaces
  with the HTML5 canvas tag.  Along side a complete API for creating new
  interface widgets, it features the following pre-built widgets:
  
   - Draggable windows
   - Buttons
   - List boxes
  
  See http://www.bitbucket.org/ant512/canvasui for more information.
  
Requirements
------------

  Any modern web browser (Safari, Chrome, anything webkit-based, Firefox, Opera)
  except for IE (due to its lack of HTML5 features and broken javascript
  support).
