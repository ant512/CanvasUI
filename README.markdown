CanvasUI
========

CanvasUI is a small javascript library for creating simple user interfaces
with the HTML5 canvas tag.  Along side a complete API for creating new
interface widgets, it features the following pre-built widgets:

 * Windows
 * Buttons
 * List boxes
 * Scrollbars
 * Labels
 * Textboxes


Requirements
------------

  Any modern web browser (Safari, Chrome, anything webkit-based, Firefox, Opera)
  except for IE (due to its lack of HTML5 features and broken javascript
  support).
